# Overview

This game lets you enjoy a TRPG story like a video game. The story consists of a world, the figures in this world, the actions and
interactions happening in the world. When starting a game, you choose a story to play.

The stories are created by people and are stored as a file. So you may create a story and give it to friends, or play a story someone else
wrote.

Stories accordingly configured can be played in multiplayer. Multiplayer is available in both split screen and network, which are not
mutually exclusive.

The application consists of three parts:
- The client is responsible for taking the user input and displaying the action.
- The virtual host runs the logic of an ongoing game.
- The server manages the user accounts, lobbies and virtual hosts of an online multiplayer server.
