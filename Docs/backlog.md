# How to use this backlog

## Priorities

As private projects may experience a vast variations of attendance, only rough categories are defined for priorities. Here they are in
order of priority:

1. in progress (we are currently working on this)
2. imminent (these are items we are going to work on once we are done withe the items "in progress")
3. soon 
4. near future
5. somewhat later (content that requiere even some "near future" items to be done beforehand)
6. something for the far future (nice ideas for after the release of version 1.0)
