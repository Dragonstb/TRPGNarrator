# TRPG Narrator

The computer leads the players through a TRPG adventure that someone (who may or may not be you) wrote.

THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT AND A PRE-ALPHA STATE. IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME UNTIL YOU CAN USE IT.

## How it works

### Step 1: Create the story

Build a world in the editor. Fill this world with creatures and people. Define stories, actions, and interactions. Once done, you can save the adventure in a file.

### Step 2: Live the story

Start a new adventure by loading the adventure file and generating your heroes.

## (planned) Features:

- Support for various input devices.
- Multiplayer with split screen and/or network (also at the same time)
